## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the `AI Brainlab` organization.
If you don't know how to use GitHub organization, find someone who does.

A quick link to `Webapp template` is [here](https://github.com/AI-Brainlab/webapp_template).
If you can not access the reposistory, contact the Organization owner.

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
